# Threadly

Threadly is a simple fashion store website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It focuses on a clean layout, modern styling, and basic interactive features like a responsive navigation menu and product search.

This project was created to practice frontend fundamentals and understand how real ecommerce layouts are structured.
